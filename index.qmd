## Bio

My name is Claudius Gräbner-Radkowitsch and I am an economist working as a Junior Professor (W1TT) at the 
[Europa University Flensburg (Germany)](https://www.uni-flensburg.de/en/pluralist-economics)
and as a research associate at the 
[Institute of Comprehensive Analysis of the Economy (ICAE)](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-for-comprehensive-analysis-of-the-economy/about-us/team/claudius-graebner/)
of the Johannes Kepler University Linz (Austria). I am also a research fellow of the 
[Institute for future-fit economies (ZOE)](https://zoe-institut.de/en/person/dr-claudius-grabner/)
.

My research is mainly concerned with the socio-economic effects of globalization, the determinants for international competitiveness, economic complexity, institutions and socio-economic development. Besides, I am also interested in economic methodology, in particular how economic models can be helpful in understanding real economic systems.

On this homepage I provide some information and material about the research projects I am responsible for, my teaching and lecturing activities, my research, and myself.
